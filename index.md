## IMPORTNACE OF PROGRAMMING
In this digital era, the knowledge of programming is essential to bring innovation and change. To create value with your own ideas you need know coding. Programming has become basic literacy for the 21st century.
  
## ALGORITHM AND REPRESENTATIONS
>Algorithm should be represented from the mental thoughts into a form which others can understand. There are primarily two ways of representing an algorithm:
>
>Flow chart: Diagrammatic way of representing the algorithm.
>Pseudo-code: Representing the algorithm between a program and normal English.</p>

## VARIABLES AND OPERATORS
1. Arithmetic operators: Used for performing arithmetic operations

Operators

Description

+  Addition

-  Subtraction

*  Multiplication

/  Division

%  Modulus

<BR>Relational operators: Also known as comparison operators, are used to compare values. Result of a relational expression is always either true or false.

Operators

Description

==    Equal to

<     Less than

>     Greater than

<=    Less than or equal to

>=    Greater than or equal to

!=    Not equal to<BR>
3.Logical operators are used to combine one or more relational expressions.

Operators

Description

AND
Result will be true, if both the expressions are true. If any one or both the expressions are false, the result will be false

OR
Result will be true, even if one of the expression is true. If both the expressions are false, the result will be false

NOT
If the expression is true, result will be false and vice versa<BR>

## VARIABLES AND THEIR CONVERSION
A variable is a name that is assigned to a value. It is done so that we can refer to that value at some later point in the program.

Let us see the usage of values and variables in a program.

During input, we receive values and assign them to variables.
During processing, we perform operations on values and variables to generate more values. These computed values are also assigned to variables.
During output, we display the computed values in variables to the end users.</P>

## CODING STANDARDS</H2

Coding standards are the set of guidelines that can be used to enhance the readability and clarity of the program and make it easy to debug and maintain the program.

## ESCAPE SEQUNCE
Escape sequence is a sequence of characters that have special meaning when enclosed in a string. It always begins with a backslash(\).
